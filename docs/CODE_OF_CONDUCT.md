# Tech and Software Club (TRADC) Open Source Code of Conduct

## Introduction

We, the contributors and maintainers of the Tech and Software Club (TRADC) open-source project, pledge to foster an open, inclusive, and respectful environment. We aim to create a space where all participants can freely collaborate, learn, and contribute without fear of discrimination or harassment.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for behavior within the TRADC community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable conduct. We invite all contributors, whether they're new or experienced, to help us uphold these principles and ensure a positive experience for everyone.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an inclusive and welcoming environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to:

- **Be Respectful:** Treat all individuals with respect, regardless of their background, identity, or opinions.
- **Be Inclusive:** Welcome contributions from people of all backgrounds and experiences.
- **Be Open-Minded:** Accept constructive feedback and be open to different ideas and viewpoints.
- **Be Empathetic:** Understand the perspectives of others and be considerate in your interactions.
- **Be Collaborative:** Strive to work together to achieve common goals.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

- Harassment, discrimination, or derogatory comments based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or any other protected status.
- Offensive, insulting, or inappropriate language and imagery.

- Any form of unwelcome or inappropriate advances.
- Disruption of discussions, talks, or events.
- Any other behavior that undermines the positive and inclusive atmosphere of the TRADC community.
